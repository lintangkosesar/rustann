Artificial Neural Network for Air Pollution Prediction in Jakarta using Rust

This project implements an artificial neural network (ANN) using the Rust programming language to predict air pollution levels in Indonesia, specifically in Jakarta. The model is trained on a dataset of 4000 entries and achieves an impressive accuracy of 97.21% after 1000 training epochs.

The ANN architecture consists of:

5 input parameters

3 hidden layers, each containing 10 neurons

3 output categories: BAIK (Good), SEDANG (Moderate), and TIDAK SEHAT (Unhealthy)

The codebase is structured in a professional and modular way, making it easy to read, maintain, and expand. This project demonstrates the potential of using Rust for machine learning tasks, especially for building efficient and safe predictive models in the environmental domain.
